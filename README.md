# DigitalOcean Classroom

The DigitalOcean classroom is a tool built with the DO API that aims to make it simple to spin up multiple droplets all configured the same way in order to teach a class, show something off at a MeetUp, or set up a hack-a-thon.

Not sure how you found this. *It's very much a work in progress!*
